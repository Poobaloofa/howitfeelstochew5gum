# Gravity Field for Math Square

A simple simulation of realistic astrophysical formulas(gravity).  Each node on the board marks a new gravity source, which the surrounding mesh of dots will interact with, and orbit around. 

Because it doesn't have an intended objective, it doesn't get clunkier with more people. If anything, it gets more exciting as dots shift orbit and maneuver throuhgout. It's quite mesmerising, so smaller kids can have just as much as fun as adults, without any complicated rules.

Intended age group: everyone
