# Crease Graph for the Dynamic Wall

This exhibit shows off several periodic functions that include a bunch of sinusoidal functions as well as others. They all generally have to be scaled to proper dimensions and have to be modified to move with a wall-friendly speed.

By using a beautifully simple function, we made creases in two contrasting wall slats. Then, by mapping that crease to a function, we made mesmerising, periodic functions that can either repeat, or switch on a timer.

When being used outside of the demonstration, the function the crease follows can be set by disabling lines 68-72 and then setting "func" on line 29 to the desired function (listed in "functions" on line 21), i.e. func="triangle" would set the crease to follow a triangle wave
