# Regression Game for the Math Square

A game for creating and understanding polynomial equations. Players on the screen become points on an nth power polynomial, and team up to fit different polynomial zones.

It is a team game - so it works better with more people.
After the players match the function, they recieve the equation of the regression they just made. This continues the exploration, if they want to graph it on their phone, or with a calculator, to play with it further.
